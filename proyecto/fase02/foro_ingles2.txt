In one particular experience at work, I had to demonstrate flexibility and adaptability when a sudden change occurred in our project management process. Our team was following a traditional waterfall approach, but due to unforeseen circumstances, we had to switch to an agile methodology to meet the project deadlines.

● How did your flexibility and adaptability help you to deal with the situation?
R:/
Embrace change: Instead of resisting or being overwhelmed by the sudden shift in the project management process, I approached it with an open mind and a positive attitude. This allowed me to see the change as an opportunity for growth and improvement rather than an obstacle.

● Would you change anything in order to deal in a better way with it?
R:/
Communicating concerns and challenges: Although I embraced the change positively, it would have been beneficial to openly communicate any concerns or challenges I encountered during the transition. By discussing potential roadblocks or uncertainties with my team and management, we could have collectively addressed them and developed strategies to overcome them more efficiently.
