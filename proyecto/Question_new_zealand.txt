The cost of living in New Zealand can vary significantly from city to city, but generally, smaller towns and rural areas tend to have lower living expenses compared to larger cities. However, if we focus on cities specifically, some of the more affordable options include:

Dunedin: Located in the South Island of New Zealand, Dunedin is known for its lower living costs compared to larger cities like Auckland and Wellington. It's a university town with a vibrant cultural scene and beautiful surroundings.

Palmerston North: Situated in the lower North Island, Palmerston North is another city known for its relatively affordable cost of living. It's a regional hub with a diverse population and offers various amenities and services.

Rotorua: Rotorua, located in the North Island, is famous for its geothermal attractions and Maori culture. It's a popular tourist destination but also offers a relatively affordable cost of living compared to larger cities in New Zealand.

Whanganui: Another city in the lower North Island, Whanganui, is known for its art scene, heritage buildings, and scenic beauty. It's considered to have a lower cost of living compared to major urban centers.

Invercargill: Invercargill is located in the far south of the South Island and is one of New Zealand's southernmost cities. It's known for its friendly community, affordable housing, and relaxed lifestyle.

While these cities generally have lower living costs compared to larger urban centers like Auckland and Wellington, it's essential to consider factors such as job opportunities, access to services, and lifestyle preferences when choosing where to live in New Zealand. Additionally, the cost of living can vary based on individual circumstances and personal choices.
