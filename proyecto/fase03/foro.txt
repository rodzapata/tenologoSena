The film is set in the mid-22nd century on the lush, habitable moon called Pandora, which orbits the gas giant Polyphemus in the Alpha Centauri star system.

The story follows Jake Sully, a paraplegic former Marine, who is selected to participate in the Avatar Program on Pandora. The program involves linking human minds with genetically engineered bodies resembling the indigenous humanoid species called the Na'vi. Jake's mission is to infiltrate the Na'vi community and gather intelligence for the human mining operation, which is extracting a valuable mineral called "unobtainium."

As Jake spends more time with the Na'vi, particularly through his avatar, he becomes torn between his loyalty to the human military-industrial complex and his growing love and respect for the Na'vi and their way of life.
