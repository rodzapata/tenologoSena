Hi guys, my name is Rodney Zapata and
I'm 47 years old
I'm from Barranquilla
I currently, live with my wife and two children
I like to watch tv series in english
because learn vocabulary and expression of the language
I like to play with my youngest son, 
because he makes me laugh all the time
I don't like eating out, because most restaurants server fatty food.
thank you for your attention.
